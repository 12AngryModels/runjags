###  This file contains a temporary hack to allow compilation between JAGS 3 and 4 without modifying runjags

###  GNU make version - permitted by CRAN for Windows only, capable of handling spaces in the JAGS include path
###############

# First construct the path to the RScalarDist.h file which we are using as a proxy for JAGS 3 vs 4
# We need to escape any spaces in @JAGS_INCLUDE@ so that we can use wildcard with the path
# space :=
# space +=
# RSDH_PATH = $(subst $(space),\$(space),@JAGS_INCLUDE@/distribution/RScalarDist.h)

# To verify that wildcard finds the file for testing:
# $(error $(wildcard $(RSDH_PATH)))

# ifneq ("$(wildcard $(RSDH_PATH))", "")
# PKG_CPPFLAGS=-I"@JAGS_INCLUDE@"
# else
# PKG_CPPFLAGS=-I"@JAGS_INCLUDE@" -D INCLUDERSCALARDIST
# endif

# This is unchanged between JAGS 3 and 4:
# PKG_LIBS=-L@JAGS_LIB@ -ljags @JAGS_RPATH@

### Verify that at least ScalarDist.h is found:
# SDH_PATH = $(subst $(space),\$(space),@JAGS_INCLUDE@/distribution/ScalarDist.h)
# ifeq ("$(wildcard $(SDH_PATH))", "")
# $(error distribution/ScalarDist.h not found - Makevars needs to be manually configured for JAGS version 3 vs 4)
# endif

###  POSIX make version - spaces in the JAGS include path will prevent compilation for JAGS 4

### LIBS and objects to be compiled
### NB: the objects in distributions/jags are only necessary for JAGS <=3, and are excluded by the sources if INCLUDERSCALARDIST is undefined
###############

OBJECTS = distributions/jags/DFunction.o distributions/jags/DPQFunction.o distributions/jags/PFunction.o distributions/jags/QFunction.o distributions/jags/RScalarDist.o distributions/DPar1.o distributions/DPar2.o distributions/DPar3.o distributions/DPar4.o distributions/DLomax.o distributions/DMouchel.o distributions/DGenPar.o distributions/DHalfCauchy.o runjags.o testrunjags.o

#### If you have compilation problems induced by these hacks then you can use the following code instead:
###############

### For JAGS major version <= 3:
# PKG_CPPFLAGS=-I@JAGS_INCLUDE@ -D INCLUDERSCALARDIST
# OBJECTS = distributions/jags/DFunction.o distributions/jags/DPQFunction.o distributions/jags/PFunction.o distributions/jags/QFunction.o distributions/jags/RScalarDist.o distributions/DPar1.o distributions/DPar2.o distributions/DPar3.o distributions/DPar4.o distributions/DLomax.o distributions/DMouchel.o distributions/DGenPar.o distributions/DHalfCauchy.o runjags.o testrunjags.o

### For JAGS major version >=4:
# PKG_CPPFLAGS=-I@JAGS_INCLUDE@
# OBJECTS = distributions/DPar1.o distributions/DPar2.o distributions/DPar3.o distributions/DPar4.o distributions/DLomax.o distributions/DMouchel.o distributions/DGenPar.o distributions/DHalfCauchy.o runjags.o testrunjags.o
