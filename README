The runjags package itself is entirely written in R, but it does contain
a JAGS module that provides additional distributions that must be
compiled for your system.  If you have a functional JAGS installation,
this *should* be done automatically in Unix when using R CMD INSTALL from
the source package.  If not, or for installing from source in windows,
see the notes below.

Note that if you want to install runjags without the additional JAGS
module you can simply remove the configure file and entire src directory
(alternatively there is a version of runjags with the JAGS module removed
hosted on the sourceforge page for runjags at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/runjags/).

Windows
-------

At compile time, there is no way for Windows to guess where the JAGS
library is installed, so you must supply the location yourself using
the make variable JAGS_ROOT, defining it in the file HOME/.R/Makevars.win
like so:

JAGS_ROOT=c:\Program Files\JAGS\JAGS-3.3.0

Unix
----

The configure script will try to guess the location of the JAGS
library installation. It will look in /<prefix>/<lib>, where

- <prefix> is the determined from the location of the jags
  script that launches the command line interface.

  For example, if this is "/usr/local/bin/jags", then prefix will
  be "/usr/local"

- <lib> is derived from the value of "LIBnn", returned by 
  "R CMD config LIBnn".

  This is particularly important on 64-bit unix, where R is 
  installed by default in /usr/local/lib64 and LIBnn is "lib64"

The configure script will also look for JAGS headers in
/<prefix>/include/JAGS

If the configure script fails to find the JAGS headers or library,
you can set the environment variables JAGS_INCLUDE and JAGS_LIB
to point to the correct directory.

Alternatively, you can use the configure options

--with-jags-include=/path/to/jags/headers 
                    (default /usr/local/include/JAGS)

--with-jags-lib=/path/to/jags/library
                (default /usr/local/[lib|lib64])

These options are onto the rjags configure script with:
"R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-jags...'
